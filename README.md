I am a recent graduate from Metropolitan State University of Denver with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems and a concentration in Cybersecurity. I am starting my masters in Cybersecurity at CU Denver in the Spring of 2026.
I have experience supporting IT infrastructure, managing server deployments, and automating provisioning using tools like Ansible and Docker.
My current focus is transitioning into a Security Engineer or Cybersecurity Analyst role, where I can apply my technical foundation in systems, networking, and security to help protect and improve enterprise environments.

## Objective

My journey in information systems and security has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
